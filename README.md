# COMS4156-Project
Repository for COMS 4156 24F, Team Scrum Masters 

EventEase is a flexible RESTful service designed to simplify and automate the complexities of event management. EventEase offers a seamless solution to manage everything from event creation to event registration. With endpoints for task management, RSVP handling, and real-time reporting, EventEase empowers various applications with robust event management capabilities, allowing organizers and hosters to focus on delivering great user experiences. EventEase API makes it easy to integrate sophisticated event planning tools into any system, no matter the size or scope of your event.

To distinguish from regular event-management services and make it useful for elderly users, Eventease provides SMS and email reminders for events, allowing elderly users to stay informed without relying on complex apps. Additionally, a simple RSVP system could be integrated, enabling one-click RSVP via email or SMS, reducing the need for navigating complicated interfaces. The API would also support caregiver collaboration, allowing caregivers to manage event details, send RSVPs, or receive notifications on behalf of elderly users. Lastly, an option for simplified, large-text invitations or event details could be offered to ensure better accessibility for users with vision impairments or low digital literacy.


## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: 
- **Spring MVC**: For structuring the application with the MVC pattern.
- **MySQL**: As the relational database for data storage.



### Installation 

## Prerequisite
- **Java 17**
- **Maven**
- **Spring Boot 3.3.4**
- **Ubuntu 24**
  
## Installing the Repository
Open the terminal in the folder in which you wish to clone the repository and enter the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/LouisLu00/COMS4156-Project.git
cd COMS4156-Project
```
## Building and running a local instance

The instructions below are for Ubuntu 24.04, however they should be the same for all platforms supported by Java and MySQL.
To build and run the service, install the following:

- **Maven 3.9.5**: [Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the installation steps. Ensure the `bin` directory is added to your system's path.
- **JDK 17**: [Download JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html), as it is the recommended version for this project.
- **MySQL 8.0**: [Download MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and follow the installation steps. Ensure the `bin` directory is added to your system's path.
- **IntelliJ IDE**: [Download IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) or use any IDE you prefer.


## Changes to be done before starting the Springboot application

## Start your MySQL server

The below command is for Ubuntu
``` bash
sudo systemctl start mysql
mysql -u root -p
```

## Changing application.properties
Going to the application.properties in the directory src/main/resources and updating application.properties with your username and password 

``` bash
# UPDATE THIS BELOW ACCORDING TO YOUR SETTINGS
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.passWord=root 
```

To run the application, use:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run 
```

## For creating a test coverage report and code style check
Generate test coverage report:
```bash
mvn jacoco:report
```

Run code style checks:
```
mvn checkstyle:check
```


# Automated CI/CD Pipeline

This project has an automatic CI/CD pipeline set up using GitHub Actions. The pipeline is triggered on every commit and pull request across the repository.

The pipeline does the following:
- Compile the Java application
- Run unit tests using `mvn test`
- Runs and publishes a JaCoCo test coverage report as an artifact
- Checks code style using Checkstyle


# Development lifecycle

For every new feature, a new branch should be created. Once that branch is ready to be merged, at least one other maintainer will need to approve it before it is able to be merged. 


# Postman Test Documentation
